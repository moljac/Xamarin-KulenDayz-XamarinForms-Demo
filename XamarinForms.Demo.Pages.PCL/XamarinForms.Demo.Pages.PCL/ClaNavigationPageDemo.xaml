	There isn't much to a NavigationPage - it's just a container for a stack of pages.

NavigationPage nav = new NavigationPage(new ContentPage() { Title = "First Page" );

Any page contained within the NavigationPage will be able to use the Navigation class to push and pop pages off of the stack.

	Just to be complete here: NavigationPage does not have a property for 
	the root page, that's why you fail at creating it from Xaml. 
	For NavigationPage, what's @CraigDunn‌ recommend is the right approach here.

	Now, if you really think Xaml is that cool, and really want doing that in 
	xaml, well, you can, using xaml 2009:
